# Credit_Card_Financial_Dashboard
Power Bi Dashboard
Project Objective:- The goal of this project was to better understand how customers use their credit cards — how much they spend, what they spend on, and who our most valuable customers are. I used Power BI to bring all this data together in a clear and interactive way that helps decision-makers quickly see the big picture and dig deeper when needed.

Steps:-
1. Combined and cleaned the data
I worked with two datasets — one with customer information and another with their transaction history. I cleaned the data, fixed missing values, and made sure everything was in the right format.

2. Connected the dots
Using Power BI, I set up relationships between the two datasets so I could explore how different types of customers behave.

3. Built the dashboard
I created charts and visuals to answer key business questions:

Who are our top revenue-generating customers?

What types of purchases bring in the most money?

Which card categories are most used?
How does revenue vary by age, income, or job?

4. Made it interactive
I added slicers and filters (like gender, quarter, and week) to allow users to explore the data from different angles.


Insights:-
1. Spending patterns: Most of the revenue comes from bills, fuel, entertainment, and groceries. People still prefer to swipe their cards over using chip or online methods.

2. Card types: The Blue card brings in the most revenue by far, followed by Silver, Gold, and Platinum.

3. Customer profiles:

Businessmen and white-collar professionals contribute the highest revenue.

People aged 60+ and those in the 30–40 age group are heavy spenders.

High-income groups naturally generate more revenue.

4. Geography and lifestyle:

California, New York, and New Jersey are top states by revenue.

Married males are among the top spending customer segments.
